**Tacit** is a primitive CSS framework for dummies, like myself, who
don't know anything about graphic design but want their web services to
look eatable. All you need is to add this line to your HTML5 layout:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="//img.teamed.io/tacit-0.1.0.min.css"/>
  </head>
</html>
```

That's all. No classes, no layouts. Just design plain and simple web pages
compliant with HTML5 and they will look OK.
